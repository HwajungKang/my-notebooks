# Live Demo's

Here i want to get a series of Live Demos that i can use to highligh the power of Qiskit. I strongly believe that all quantum applications can be written as four steps. 

1. Map the problem to a Quantum Native format (Set of Operators, and a set of Quantum Circuits)
2. Optimize the circuits and operators to run on quantum hardware
3. Solve using quantum primitive functions (estimator or Sampler)
4. Post process
